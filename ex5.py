#   â€¢ In this exercise, you will implement basic search algorithms and attempts to
#   confirm theoretical complexity findings with empirical measures
#   1. Implement linear search and binary search [0.5 pts]
#   2. Measure the performance of each on sorted vectors of 1000, 2000, 4000,
#   8000, 16000, 32000 elements . In each case, you must do the following for
#   1000 times, and compute the average [0.5 pts]:
#       a. Pick a random element in the vector
#       b. Measure the time it takes to find the element using timeit, using 100
#       iterations (number=100)
