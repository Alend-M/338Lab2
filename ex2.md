1. Interpolation searching is often faster than binary searching. This is because interpolation searching starts its search at the point where the key is most likely to occur. In contrast, binary searching will always start at the middle of the dataset, regardless of the value of the key. This property also makes interpolation searching much better for use on uniformly ordered data.
2. Yes, the performance would be affected. If the distribution is not uniform, the search may take significantly longer to complete, as the estimation of the 'most likely position' for the key to occur will no longer be accurate.
3. To follow a different distribution, the part of the code that specifies the position (pos = low + ...) should be altered to account for the distribution being used in the dataset. By changing this value, the serach algorithm will be able to pick a more accurate starting point for the search.
4. Linear search is preferred when the data is not sorted. Both binary and interpolation search require the data to be sorted as they start from a 'midpoint' between the values and check for the position of the key relative to the midpoint. When the data is not sorted, it would be more effective to check each value for the key one-by-one.
5. Linear search will outperform both binary and interpolation searching when the dataset is small. If the dataset is small enough, checking based on a midpoint would be more time consuming than checking each value for the key individually.
6. To improve binary and interpolation searching for small datasets, it may be better to use a smaller jump when searching between elements. This would allow the search to avoid overshooting the key.
